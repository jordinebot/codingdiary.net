I am Jordi Nebot, a Web Developer from [Manresa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manresa), (Barcelona). This is my coding
diary. A blog about coding, tech and other geeky stuff.  I mainly write this diary for myself, to keep track of my
journey to become a better developer but, of course, I'd like it to be useful to others too.

A secondary goal for this blog is to practice and improve my written English. I am not a native English speaker, so if
you see some horrible mistake here I'll be very grateful if you [let me know](https://github.com/jordinebot/my-coding-diary/labels/spelling%20mistake).

Thank you and welcome!
